This is a program that will help us solve sudoku puzzles by implementing the AC3 algorithm.

Helper functions are used to print out a sudoku board, and to check if the sudoku board is solved. A main function with 3 test cases is also used. 

The function solve_sudoku takes in a sudoku board as a 2d list of size [9][9]. Blank spots are represented as '*', all other spots have digits places.
