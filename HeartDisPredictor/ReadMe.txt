In this project, I use a simplified version of a Heart Disease dataset, as well as Logistic Regression Classifier to predict Heart Disease based on 
the training and testing datasets I build, then compute and report the accuracy. I also plot the ROC Curve for this classifier, and compute the Area under the curve
for the ROC.
