Here I use Random Forest and a manually developed ensemble learning method (Bagging) to create a predictor for Cancer Diagnosis by using a real
dataset from the UCI database (a csv file). A decision tree classifier is used to predict cancer based on the training and testing datasets that I
build, then the accuracy scores of the classifier is calculated and reported.
