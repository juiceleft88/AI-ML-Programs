Working with a real dataset which includes average credit card debt for a number of individuals as a target, as well as several features: age, number
of credit cards, education, income, credit limit, marital status, and credit rating. I use Linear Regression to train a linear model on the training set which I
have created, and using the coefficients of the model, evaluate which feature is the most important and least important. I also predic "balance" for the users
in the testing set, and compare the predicted balance with the actual balance by calculating and reporting the RMSE.
Finally, I use 10-fold Cross Validation to evaluate the performance of a linear regression in predicting the balance, and calculate the RMSE using this method.
