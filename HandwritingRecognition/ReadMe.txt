The goal of this project is to build a machine learning algorithm that can recognize the hand written digits from a provided dataset of 1797 small (8x8) images,
each one including a hand-written digit (0-9). The csv file provided includes the labels of the images, and I used the help of matplotlib to load images, and sklear to split the
dataset into testing and training sets. I used a Random Forest method to create the algorithm.
