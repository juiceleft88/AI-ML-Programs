In this program, we implement the Minimax algorithm for tic-tac-toe. More specifically, we use X to make the best decisions based on a 'score' system.
The agent must use recursion to explore possible solutions and make the best decision at each depth. The X-move function should take in a board state 
as an argument, run minimax, and return the best move for X at that turn.
