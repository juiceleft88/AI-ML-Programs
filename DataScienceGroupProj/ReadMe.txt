This project was a semester-long effort to create a machine learning algorithm that would identify the different species of butterflies based on provided image sets. The original competition and prompt was provided on kaggle, and we provided our solution as part of our end-of-year assignment. Images of butterflies will be given to help train the machine to spot their characteristics, allowing it to understand which characteristics belong to which butterfly, effectively classifying them in a quick and orderly manner. By classifying the butterfly we are able to realize which butterfly will be Yum (Non-poisonous) or Yuck (Poisonous) based on the butterfly characteristics. 

Various classification techniques are used throughout our program, and the final report with our findings is provided here.
